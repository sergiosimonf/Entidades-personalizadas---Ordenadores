Act as a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to extract information from technical documents or PC specification listings. The extracted information should be in a format compatible with the provided database.

# Details

Identify and extract values related to the following tags from the provided file. Each tag corresponds to a column in the described database:

- `model`: Model name or reference of the PC.
- `price`: Price of the PC in decimal format (up to 2 decimal places).
- `processor`: Name of the processor (e.g., Intel Core i5, AMD Ryzen 7).
- `ram_gb`: RAM capacity in GB.
- `storage`: Storage capacity (in GB or TB, convert to GB if necessary).
- `graphics`: Graphics card or GPU (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060).
- `inchs`: Screen size in inches.

# Output Format

The model should produce a JSON object with a list of extracted items, each being a set of tags and corresponding values, following this structure:

```json
[
  {
    "model": "string",
    "price": "decimal",
    "processor": "string",
    "ram_gb": "integer",
    "storage": "integer",
    "graphics": "string",
    "inchs": "integer"
  }
]
```

If no information is found for a tag, leave the field empty (`null`).

# Sample Input

Source document:
```
Dell Inspiron 15 3000: Intel Core i5 1135G7, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce MX330, 15.6 inches, $599.99.
Asus ROG Strix G17 Gaming: AMD Ryzen 7 6800H, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060, 17.3 inches, $1,249.00.
```

# Sample Output

```json
[
  {
    "model": "Dell Inspiron 15 3000",
    "price": 599.99,
    "processor": "Intel Core i5 1135G7",
    "ram_gb": 8,
    "storage": 512,
    "graphics": "NVIDIA GeForce MX330",
    "inchs": 15
  },
  {
    "model": "Asus ROG Strix G17 Gaming",
    "price": 1249.00,
    "processor": "AMD Ryzen 7 6800H",
    "ram_gb": 16,
    "storage": 1000,
    "graphics": "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060",
    "inchs": 17
  }
]
```

# Notes

- **Optional Preprocessing**: Remember to adapt values where necessary, such as converting storage sizes from TB to GB (1 TB = 1024 GB).
- The tags should retain the accuracy of the names detected directly from the text.
- If a measure does not include explicit units, assume the most likely one (e.g., storage in GB).
- Follow the specified typology and format for each field in the database.
